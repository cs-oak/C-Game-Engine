A game engine I wrote entirely in C++. The game itself is fairly simple, and more of a test of the engine than a proper game.
Using make should give you the executable and take care of other things. Note that you will require the SDL 1.2 library to
build the game.

The music for the this game belongs to the 1989 game Guardian Legend designed by Compile Software, Japan. All rights belong to
them if they still exist, or whover owns the rights to this IP now. I do not wish to use this project for commercial purposes. All sprites
used in this game can be found in the links mentioned below:
