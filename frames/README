This is a video game I built entirely in C++, and using a bit of XML.
It's a fairly simple game, more a test of the engine than an actual
game, but you could have some fun with it. Using the makefile should
take care of everything for you. Pressing F1 in the game should bring
up the help menu.

The music for this game has been taken from the 1989 game Guardian
Legend, by Compile Software, and all rights belong to them if they
still exist, or whoever holds this IP. I do not intend to use any
content from that game for commercial purposes. THe sprites used
for this game can be found in the links mentioned below.
